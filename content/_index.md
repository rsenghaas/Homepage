I am currently a master student in physics of [Prof. Dr. Johannes Walcher](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~walcher/) at Universit√§t Heidelberg.
I'm part of the STRUCTURES YRC.

My research interests include Mathematical Physics and Algebraic Geometry (see [Research]({{< ref "/research" >}} "Research")).

From August 2019 until June 2020, I studied at the Tsinghua University in Beijing.

I'm a member of the [Eomii](https://www.eomii.org/) team since April 2022.
