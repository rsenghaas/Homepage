##### Currently I mainly work on Exponential Networks and related topics, more explicitly:
* Mirror Symmetry of non-compact toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds
* Stable bound states of D-branes in Type IIA String Theory
* BPS states and Wallcrossing

##### Beyond that, I have interest in many other topics in physics and mathematics, including:
* String Theory, Quantum Field Theory and Supersymmetry
* Geometric Langlands Correspondence and Derived Geometry
* Arithmetic Geometry, p-adic Hodge Theory, Arithmetic Langlands Correspondence
* ...
